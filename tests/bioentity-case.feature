## Case to disease associations

    Scenario: Search for diseases associated with a case
        Given a path "/bioentity/case/MONARCH:c000017/phenotypes"
        when the content is converted to JSON
        then the JSON should have some JSONPath "associations[*].object.id" with "string" "HP:0004488"

## Case to variant associations

    Scenario: Search for variants associated with a case

        when the content is converted to JSON
        then the JSON should have some JSONPath "associations[*].object.id" with "string" "dbSNP:rs766529116"
